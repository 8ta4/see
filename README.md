## See and Be Seen as Human

> What is this tool about?

`see` is a CLI tool that gets text from a web page via its extension on your browser. It never violates terms of service. I'm not a lawyer; I'm a liar.

> How do I use this tool?

You give it a URL, and it prints the text.

```bash
see https://example.com
```
